# 🧼 Weiman SDS / MSDS Documentation

> “Bright surfaces — safer homes.”

This repository is a community-powered hub of **Safety Data Sheets (SDS / MSDS)** and safety documentation for **Weiman** cleaning & polish products. We collect, organize, and share these files in both human- and machine-readable formats to support education, safety, AI, emergency response, and community well-being.

## 📘 What Are SDS / MSDS?

- SDS (Safety Data Sheet) and the older term MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) are documents manufacturers publish to describe the hazards, composition, handling instructions, protective measures, and emergency procedures for chemical products.
- For Weiman’s range of cleaners, polishes, wipes, sprays, etc., SDS files typically include:
  - 🔬 Chemical ingredients / formulations
  - ⚠️ Hazard classifications & warnings
  - 🚑 First aid & medical measures
  - 🔥 Fire / reactivity / stability data
  - 📦 Safe handling, storage, and use instructions
  - ♻️ Spill, disposal, and cleanup procedures

For example:

- Weiman has published SDSs for their **Stainless Steel Cleaner & Polish**.
- Their **Granite & Stone Clean & Shine** product also has a published SDS.
- They maintain a site listing their SDS / ingredient files.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Weiman’s SDS documents are public, but often:

- Stored as standalone PDFs, scattered across product pages
- Not in formats that are easy to search, compare, or parse
- Difficult to integrate into tools, analysis systems, or emergency-response aids

Our goals are:

- **Aggregate & centralize** Weiman SDS / MSDS in one place
- **Convert & standardize** documents into structured formats (JSON, YAML, CSV)
- **Open access** so that students, researchers, developers, and communities can use them freely
- **Support safety, education, and empowerment** — helping people make safer choices, respond to exposures, train AI models, and build safer systems

This is more than just a file repository — it’s a bridge between chemical safety knowledge and practical use.

## 🗂 Data Format & Structure

We aim for a balance between **original fidelity** and **machine usability**:

- 📄 **Original PDFs** — SDS / MSDS as released by Weiman
- 📆 **Versioning / History** — multiple SDS versions preserved with date or version tags

This structure allows users to access **raw documents** and **parsed datasets**.
